defmodule AWS.SSM do
  @moduledoc """
  This is the Amazon EC2 Simple Systems Manager (SSM) API Reference. SSM
  enables you to remotely manage the configuration of your Amazon EC2
  instances, virtual machines (VMs), or servers in your on-premises
  environment or in an environment provided by other cloud providers using
  scripts, commands, or the Amazon EC2 console. SSM includes an on-demand
  solution called *Amazon EC2 Run Command* and a lightweight instance
  configuration solution called *SSM Config*.

  This references is intended to be used with the EC2 Run Command User Guide
  for
  [Linux](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/execute-remote-commands.html)
  or
  [Windows](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/execute-remote-commands.html).

  <note> You must register your on-premises servers and VMs through an
  activation process before you can configure them using Run Command.
  Registered servers and VMs are called *managed instances*. For more
  information, see [Setting Up Run Command On Managed Instances (On-Premises
  Servers and VMs) on
  Linux](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/managed-instances.html)
  or [Setting Up Run Command On Managed Instances (On-Premises Servers and
  VMs) on
  Windows](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/managed-instances.html).

  </note> **Run Command**

  Run Command provides an on-demand experience for executing commands. You
  can use pre-defined SSM documents to perform the actions listed later in
  this section, or you can create your own documents. With these documents,
  you can remotely configure your instances by sending commands using the
  **Commands** page in the [Amazon EC2
  console](http://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/), [AWS Tools for Windows
  PowerShell](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Amazon_Simple_Systems_Management_cmdlets.html),
  the [AWS
  CLI](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ssm/index.html), or
  AWS SDKs.

  Run Command reports the status of the command execution for each instance
  targeted by a command. You can also audit the command execution to
  understand who executed commands, when, and what changes were made. By
  switching between different SSM documents, you can quickly configure your
  instances with different types of commands. To get started with Run
  Command, verify that your environment meets the prerequisites for remotely
  running commands on EC2 instances
  ([Linux](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/remote-commands-prereq.html)
  or
  [Windows](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/remote-commands-prereq.html)).

  <p/> **SSM Config**

  SSM Config is a lightweight instance configuration solution. SSM Config is
  currently only available for Windows instances. With SSM Config, you can
  specify a setup configuration for your instances. SSM Config is similar to
  EC2 User Data, which is another way of running one-time scripts or applying
  settings during instance launch. SSM Config is an extension of this
  capability. Using SSM documents, you can specify which actions the system
  should perform on your instances, including which applications to install,
  which AWS Directory Service directory to join, which Microsoft PowerShell
  modules to install, etc. If an instance is missing one or more of these
  configurations, the system makes those changes. By default, the system
  checks every five minutes to see if there is a new configuration to apply
  as defined in a new SSM document. If so, the system updates the instances
  accordingly. In this way, you can remotely maintain a consistent
  configuration baseline on your instances. SSM Config is available using the
  AWS CLI or the AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell. For more information, see
  [Managing Windows Instance
  Configuration](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/ec2-configuration-manage.html).

  SSM Config and Run Command include the following pre-defined documents.

  **Linux**

  <ul> <li> **AWS-RunShellScript** to run shell scripts

  </li> <li> **AWS-UpdateSSMAgent** to update the Amazon SSM agent

  </li> </ul> <p/> **Windows**

  <ul> <li> **AWS-JoinDirectoryServiceDomain** to join an AWS Directory

  </li> <li> **AWS-RunPowerShellScript** to run PowerShell commands or
  scripts

  </li> <li> **AWS-UpdateEC2Config** to update the EC2Config service

  </li> <li> **AWS-ConfigureWindowsUpdate** to configure Windows Update
  settings

  </li> <li> **AWS-InstallApplication** to install, repair, or uninstall
  software using an MSI package

  </li> <li> **AWS-InstallPowerShellModule** to install PowerShell modules

  </li> <li> **AWS-ConfigureCloudWatch** to configure Amazon CloudWatch Logs
  to monitor applications and systems

  </li> <li> **AWS-ListWindowsInventory** to collect information about an EC2
  instance running in Windows.

  </li> <li> **AWS-FindWindowsUpdates** to scan an instance and determines
  which updates are missing.

  </li> <li> **AWS-InstallMissingWindowsUpdates** to install missing updates
  on your EC2 instance.

  </li> <li> **AWS-InstallSpecificWindowsUpdates** to install one or more
  specific updates.

  </li> </ul> <important> The commands or scripts specified in SSM documents
  run with administrative privilege on your instances because the Amazon SSM
  agent runs as root on Linux and the EC2Config service runs in the Local
  System account on Windows. If a user has permission to execute any of the
  pre-defined SSM documents (any document that begins with AWS-*) then that
  user also has administrator access to the instance. Delegate access to Run
  Command and SSM Config judiciously. This becomes extremely important if you
  create your own SSM documents. Amazon Web Services does not provide
  guidance about how to create secure SSM documents. You create SSM documents
  and delegate access to Run Command at your own risk. As a security best
  practice, we recommend that you assign access to "AWS-*" documents,
  especially the AWS-RunShellScript document on Linux and the
  AWS-RunPowerShellScript document on Windows, to trusted administrators
  only. You can create SSM documents for specific tasks and delegate access
  to non-administrators.

  </important> For information about creating and sharing SSM documents, see
  the following topics in the SSM User Guide:

  <ul> <li> [Creating SSM
  Documents](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/create-ssm-doc.html)
  and [Sharing SSM
  Documents](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ssm-sharing.html)

  Adds or overwrites one or more tags for the specified resource. Tags are
  metadata that you assign to your managed instances. Tags enable you to
  categorize your managed instances in different ways, for example, by
  purpose, owner, or environment. Each tag consists of a key and an optional
  value, both of which you define. For example, you could define a set of
  tags for your account's managed instances that helps you track each
  instance's owner and stack level. For example: Key=Owner and Value=DbAdmin,
  SysAdmin, or Dev. Or Key=Stack and Value=Production, Pre-Production, or
  Test. Each resource can have a maximum of 10 tags.

  We recommend that you devise a set of tag keys that meets your needs for
  each resource type. Using a consistent set of tag keys makes it easier for
  you to manage your resources. You can search and filter the resources based
  on the tags you add. Tags don't have any semantic meaning to Amazon EC2 and
  are interpreted strictly as a string of characters.

  For more information about tags, see [Tagging Your Amazon EC2
  Resources](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Tags.html)

  @moduledoc """
  Application Auto Scaling is a general purpose Auto Scaling service for
  supported elastic AWS resources. With Application Auto Scaling, you can
  automatically scale your AWS resources, with an experience similar to that
  of Auto Scaling.

  <note> At this time, Application Auto Scaling only supports scaling Amazon
  ECS services.

  </note> For example, you can use Application Auto Scaling to accomplish the
  following tasks:

  <ul> <li> Define scaling policies for automatically adjusting your
  applicationâ€™s resources

  </li> <li> Scale your resources in response to CloudWatch alarms

  </li> <li> View history of your scaling events

  </li> </ul> Application Auto Scaling is available in the following regions:

  <ul> <li> `us-east-1`

  </li> <li> `us-west-1`

  </li> <li> `us-west-2`

  </li> <li> `ap-southeast-1`

  </li> <li> `ap-southeast-2`

  </li> <li> `ap-northeast-1`

  </li> <li> `eu-central-1`

  </li> <li> `eu-west-1`

  </li> </ul>

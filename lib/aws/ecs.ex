  @moduledoc """
  Amazon EC2 Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable, fast,
  container management service that makes it easy to run, stop, and manage
  Docker containers on a cluster of EC2 instances. Amazon ECS lets you launch
  and stop container-enabled applications with simple API calls, allows you
  to get the state of your cluster from a centralized service, and gives you
  access to many familiar Amazon EC2 features like security groups, Amazon
  EBS volumes, and IAM roles.

  You can use Amazon ECS to schedule the placement of containers across your
  cluster based on your resource needs, isolation policies, and availability
  requirements. Amazon EC2 Container Service eliminates the need for you to
  operate your own cluster management and configuration management systems or
  worry about scaling your management infrastructure.
  """

  @doc """
  Creates a new Amazon ECS cluster. By default, your account receives a
  `default` cluster when you launch your first container instance. However,
  you can create your own cluster with a unique name with the `CreateCluster`
  action.

  def create_cluster(client, input, options \\ []) do
    request(client, "CreateCluster", input, options)
  end

  @doc """
  Runs and maintains a desired number of tasks from a specified task
  definition. If the number of tasks running in a service drops below
  `desiredCount`, Amazon ECS spawns another instantiation of the task in the
  specified cluster. To update an existing service, see `UpdateService`.

  In addition to maintaining the desired count of tasks in your service, you
  can optionally run your service behind a load balancer. The load balancer
  distributes traffic across the tasks that are associated with the service.
  For more information, see [Service Load
  Balancing](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-load-balancing.html)
  in the *Amazon EC2 Container Service Developer Guide*.

  You can optionally specify a deployment configuration for your service.
  During a deployment (which is triggered by changing the task definition of
  a service with an `UpdateService` operation), the service scheduler uses
  the `minimumHealthyPercent` and `maximumPercent` parameters to determine
  the deployment strategy.

  If the `minimumHealthyPercent` is below 100%, the scheduler can ignore the
  `desiredCount` temporarily during a deployment. For example, if your
  service has a `desiredCount` of four tasks, a `minimumHealthyPercent` of
  50% allows the scheduler to stop two existing tasks before starting two new
  tasks. Tasks for services that *do not* use a load balancer are considered
  healthy if they are in the `RUNNING` state; tasks for services that *do*
  use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the `RUNNING`
  state and the container instance it is hosted on is reported as healthy by
  the load balancer. The default value for `minimumHealthyPercent` is 50% in
  the console and 100% for the AWS CLI, the AWS SDKs, and the APIs.

  The `maximumPercent` parameter represents an upper limit on the number of
  running tasks during a deployment, which enables you to define the
  deployment batch size. For example, if your service has a `desiredCount` of
  four tasks, a `maximumPercent` value of 200% starts four new tasks before
  stopping the four older tasks (provided that the cluster resources required
  to do this are available). The default value for `maximumPercent` is 200%.

  When the service scheduler launches new tasks, it attempts to balance them
  across the Availability Zones in your cluster with the following logic:

  <ul> <li> Determine which of the container instances in your cluster can
  support your service's task definition (for example, they have the required
  CPU, memory, ports, and container instance attributes).

  </li> <li> Sort the valid container instances by the fewest number of
  running tasks for this service in the same Availability Zone as the
  instance. For example, if zone A has one running service task and zones B
  and C each have zero, valid container instances in either zone B or C are
  considered optimal for placement.

  </li> <li> Place the new service task on a valid container instance in an
  optimal Availability Zone (based on the previous steps), favoring container
  instances with the fewest number of running tasks for this service.

  </li> </ul>

  Deletes the specified cluster. You must deregister all container instances
  from this cluster before you may delete it. You can list the container
  instances in a cluster with `ListContainerInstances` and deregister them

  Deletes a specified service within a cluster. You can delete a service if
  you have no running tasks in it and the desired task count is zero. If the
  service is actively maintaining tasks, you cannot delete it, and you must
  update the service to a desired task count of zero. For more information,
  see `UpdateService`.

  <note> When you delete a service, if there are still running tasks that
  require cleanup, the service status moves from `ACTIVE` to `DRAINING`, and
  the service is no longer visible in the console or in `ListServices` API
  operations. After the tasks have stopped, then the service status moves
  from `DRAINING` to `INACTIVE`. Services in the `DRAINING` or `INACTIVE`
  status can still be viewed with `DescribeServices` API operations; however,
  in the future, `INACTIVE` services may be cleaned up and purged from Amazon
  ECS record keeping, and `DescribeServices` API operations on those services
  will return a `ServiceNotFoundException` error.

  Deregistering a container instance removes the instance from a cluster, but
  it does not terminate the EC2 instance; if you are finished using the

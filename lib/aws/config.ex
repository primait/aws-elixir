  AWS Config

  AWS Config provides a way to keep track of the configurations of all the
  AWS resources associated with your AWS account. You can use AWS Config to
  get the current and historical configurations of each AWS resource and also
  to get information about the relationship between the resources. An AWS
  resource can be an Amazon Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance, an Elastic
  Block Store (EBS) volume, an Elastic network Interface (ENI), or a security
  group. For a complete list of resources currently supported by AWS Config,
  see [Supported AWS
  Resources](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/resource-config-reference.html#supported-resources).

  You can access and manage AWS Config through the AWS Management Console,
  the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), the AWS Config API, or the AWS
  SDKs for AWS Config

  This reference guide contains documentation for the AWS Config API and the
  AWS CLI commands that you can use to manage AWS Config.

  The AWS Config API uses the Signature Version 4 protocol for signing
  requests. For more information about how to sign a request with this
  protocol, see [Signature Version 4 Signing
  Process](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html).

  For detailed information about AWS Config features and their associated
  actions or commands, as well as how to work with AWS Management Console,
  see [What Is AWS
  Config?](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/WhatIsConfig.html)
  in the *AWS Config Developer Guide*.

  Deletes the specified AWS Config rule and all of its evaluation results.

  AWS Config sets the state of a rule to `DELETING` until the deletion is
  complete. You cannot update a rule while it is in this state. If you make a

  receive a `ResourceInUseException`.

  You can check the state of a rule by using the `DescribeConfigRules`

  Adds or updates an AWS Config rule for evaluating whether your AWS

  You can use this action for custom Config rules and AWS managed Config
  rules. A custom Config rule is a rule that you develop and maintain. An AWS
  managed Config rule is a customizable, predefined rule that AWS Config
  provides.

  If you are adding a new custom Config rule, you must first create the AWS
  Lambda function that the rule invokes to evaluate your resources. When you
  use the `PutConfigRule` action to add the rule to AWS Config, you must
  specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that AWS Lambda assigns to the
  function. Specify the ARN for the `SourceIdentifier` key. This key is part
  of the `Source` object, which is part of the `ConfigRule` object.

  If you are adding a new AWS managed Config rule, specify the rule's
  identifier for the `SourceIdentifier` key. To reference AWS managed Config
  rule identifiers, see [Using AWS Managed Config
  Rules](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/evaluate-config_use-managed-rules.html).

  For any new rule that you add, specify the `ConfigRuleName` in the
  `ConfigRule` object. Do not specify the `ConfigRuleArn` or the
  `ConfigRuleId`. These values are generated by AWS Config for new rules.

  If you are updating a rule that you have added previously, specify the
  rule's `ConfigRuleName`, `ConfigRuleId`, or `ConfigRuleArn` in the
  `ConfigRule` data type that you use in this request.

  The maximum number of rules that AWS Config supports is 25.
